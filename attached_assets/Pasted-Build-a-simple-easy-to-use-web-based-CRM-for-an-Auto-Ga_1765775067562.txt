Build a simple, easy-to-use web-based CRM for an Auto Garage using MongoDB as the database. The UI should follow a red and black theme, be clean, modern, mobile-friendly, and understandable by non-technical garage staff. The system should be structured so that each car visit is one job, and each job moves through clear car service stages.

Core Working Logic

Each customer can have multiple vehicles, and each vehicle can have multiple service visits. Every service visit should be treated as a Job, and the job should move through these stages: New Lead → Inspection Done → Work In Progress → Ready for Delivery → Completed → Cancelled. Changing a stage should be very easy using a dropdown or buttons, and this stage change will later trigger WhatsApp updates automatically.

1. Lead Management & Car Stages

Create a job funnel where each job stores customer name, phone number, vehicle number, vehicle model, service type, assigned technician, notes, and current stage. The funnel should visually show all active cars in different stages so the manager can instantly see workshop status.

2. WhatsApp Automation (API Plug-and-Play)

Implement a simple WhatsApp automation system using placeholder functions, not real API integration yet. Each job stage should have a predefined editable message (for example: inspection completed, work started, car ready). When the job stage changes, call a function like sendWhatsAppMessage(phone, message). Keep the logic clean so that when an API key is added later, WhatsApp messages work immediately without code changes.

3. Job Card Management

Each job should have a digital job card containing service checklist, technician notes, materials used, and optional image uploads. The job card should always stay linked to the job stage and customer vehicle.

4. Technician Assignment

Allow adding technicians with name, skill type, and availability. Assign technicians to jobs easily using dropdowns. Show technician workload in a simple way so no one is overloaded.

5. Customer & Vehicle Records

Create customer profiles with name and phone number. Each customer can have multiple vehicles, and each vehicle should show a full service history timeline with past jobs, stages, and invoices. Searching by phone number or vehicle number should be fast and simple.

6. Billing & Invoicing

Generate invoices directly from job cards. Include services, products, labor charges, tax, discounts, and total amount. The invoice layout should be clean, printable, and ready for PDF export later.

7. Payment Tracking

Track payment status as Pending, Partially Paid, or Paid. Support multiple payment modes like Cash, UPI, Card, and Bank Transfer. Clearly show outstanding balance before delivery.

8. Appointment Scheduler

Create a simple appointment calendar where staff can book slots by date and time. Prevent double booking. When an appointment is confirmed, automatically convert it into a job.

9. Inventory Management

Track inventory such as PPF rolls (meters), ceramic products, chemicals, and tools. Support stock in/out, low stock alerts, and link inventory usage to job cards.

10. Reports & Dashboard

Build a dashboard with easy-to-read charts showing total cars serviced, monthly revenue, pending jobs, technician workload, and inventory usage. Use MongoDB aggregation for reports.

Technical Requirements

Use MongoDB with Mongoose, a modular backend structure, and a clean React frontend. Keep all code well-commented and simple. Use mock data and placeholder services where needed. Design the system so future integrations (WhatsApp API, payment gateway, mobile app) can be added easily without rewriting logic.
